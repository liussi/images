# Images

Our program offers a convenient way to browse through photos based on your query. It includes a search field where you can enter keywords to search for photos. Upon searching, you'll receive results in the form of multiple photos displayed on the page, with pagination.

To view a photo in a larger size, you can click on the "View" button. This opens a modal window with the selected photo, allowing you to examine the image in detail.

For convenience, the modal window can also be closed by clicking the "Esc" button on the keyboard or by clicking on the backdrop outside the photo boundaries. This allows you to quickly and easily browse through many photos without leaving the search page. Styling is done using Styled Components.
